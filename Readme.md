#Primes Benchmark

So I got bored that one weekend ... I don't even remember how I got the idea of
trying this out, but I ended up calculating the prime numbers up to 1,000,000
in different languages.

Feel free to run those programs yourself, otherwise my timings are below. I ran
those on a Mid-2010 MacBook Pro with a 2.66 GHz Core i7, memory and harddisk do
not matter for this kind of program.
